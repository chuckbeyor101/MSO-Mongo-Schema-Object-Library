# MSO (Mongo Schema Object Library)

**MSO** is a lightweight **Object-Document Mapper (ODM)** for **MongoDB** that allows Python developers to interact with MongoDB collections in an intuitive and Pythonic way. It offers the flexibility of a schema-less database with the convenience of strongly-typed classes, enabling seamless operations on MongoDB collections using familiar Python patterns.

## Key Features:

- **Dynamic Model Generation**: Automatically generates Python classes based on MongoDB schema definitions or directly from your MongoDB collection's structure.
- **Simple and Intuitive API**: Use common Pythonic patterns such as `find_one()`, `find_many()`, `save()`, `update()`, `delete()`, and more, to interact with your MongoDB data.
- **Non-Blocking and Asynchronous**: Built-in support for non-blocking database interactions, ideal for modern asynchronous Python applications.
- **Customizable Schema**: Provides flexibility in defining your schema, including automatic data validation and schema enforcement during document insertion or update.
- **Deeply Nested Models**: Supports deeply nested objects and arrays, allowing for complex MongoDB documents to be easily represented and manipulated.
